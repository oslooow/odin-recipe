    <h3>Gudeg is a traditional Javanese dish from Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia. Gudeg is made from young unripe jack fruit (Javanese: gori, Indonesian: nangka muda) stewed for several hours with palm sugar, and coconut milk. Additional spices include garlic, shallot, candlenut, coriander seed, galangal, bay leaves, and teak leaves, the latter giving a reddish-brown color to the dish. It is often described as "green jack fruit sweet stew".

    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bay leaves, lime leaves, galangal, lemongrass, tea bag, salt, palm sugar, and spice paste into a soup pot. If you have a claypot big enough to cook this, it will be even better.</li>
        <li>Add jack-fruit into the pot. Pour coconut milk into the pot, making sure that everything is submerged, bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat, add hard boiled eggs (if using), and simmer on the lowest heat setting possible until all liquid is fully absorbed by the jack-fruit and eggs. Stir every 30 minutes or so. This process should take about 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, adjust seasoning as needed, some people really like their gudeg to be on the sweet side. Remove all the leaves. Transfer to a serving plate and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
